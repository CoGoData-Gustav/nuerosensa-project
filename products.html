        <p>The NeuroSensa System utilizes custom sensors with a patented methodology to measure the electrodermal activity of the skin.
            Localized changes in electrodermal activity and galvanic skin response can be detected by our NeuroSensa System. They areoften one of the 
            earliest signs of peripheral neuropathies. often preceding other clinical symptoms.

            <p>Our device is FDA registered as a Class II medical device. The initial clinical trials determined that the device is 95%
                accurate in terms of locality and 94% accurate in terms of intensity. Our Gen 2 device is lighter, waterproof, easy to
                operate and communicates directly with the analytical software installed on iOS or Android devices. revolutionizing
                the way worker compensation patients are treated. how opioid and controlled narcotics prescriptions are written.
                and how physical therapy results are tracked. The applications are endless.</p>

            <p>Pain experience fluctuates across the recovery timeline. Traditional imaging devices (x-rays, MRls, etc.) are only able to capture that experience at single
                isolated points in time. With our device, clinicians have the ability to capture, track, and evaluate a patient's pain experience across the entire recovery timeline,
                allowing treatments to be dynamically adjusted based on real-time feedback.
