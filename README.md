## Rationale Behind Web Development Framework for the Dashboard Application

**Web Development Framework - Flask**
- Flask is a microframework, meaning it has a small core but allows for extensive customization and flexibility.
- Flask has a gentle learning curve, making it an excellent choice for beginners or for quickly prototyping web applications.
- Unlike larger frameworks like Django, Flask gives developers full control over the components they use and how they structure their application.

**Programming Languages - Python, HTML, CSS**
- Flask is a Python web framework, so much of the backend logic, including data processing, manipulation, and validation, is written in Python.
- As mentioned, HTML is essential for the construction of web pages.
- CSS allows for customization and the design of web pages.
